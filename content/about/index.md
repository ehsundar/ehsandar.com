I'm Amir. I live in Tehran, Iran. I'm a software engineer and currently working at Divar.

## Work Experience

### Divar

I started to work as a backend developer in 2019.
After the interview, I was chosen to take part in the Summercamp 2019.
During the two months of internship, I learned about the company's culture and the technologies they use.
We developed a basic auction platform using Django.
Despite the hard skills I'd learned during the period,
I practiced teamwork and communication skills which are crucial in a professional environment.

After the internship, I was assigned to the Divar's ad review team.
We used to develop software to facilitate human reviewers as well as to automate the process.
We increased the automation factor by a substantial amount which led to a significant decrease in the review time.
I also worked on the resiliency and reliability of the system
so that end-users would not encounter unexpected scenarios.

In 2021, I was transferred to the marketplace team,
in which we used to provide new facilities to our professional users.
It was here in the marketplace team 
that I needed to implement new features in our submit repository.
Soon I got familiar with the architecture and made a few improvement in the infrastructure too.

The more features developed on the submit services, 
it got slower and more complex.
In mid 2021, A catastrophic incident led to initiation of a new team for maintaining 

Submit

Open Platform

### Arkan Ara Co.

I started to work as a Qt developer in 2017.
I developed different pieces of software of an electrocardiogram device.
The code was written in C++ and we used Qt framework for the GUI part.
The whole system was running on a raspberry pi device,
where I learned to work with the terminal for the first time.
Soon I realized that developing software is much easier on a Linux machine, so I switched to Ubuntu right away.
I had a hard time figuring out how to cross compile the code for the raspberry pi devices as
the online resources was not as helpful as they are today.

I also initiated a number of projects
which involved working with BLE devices and sensors,
namely SensorTile by ST and an uncommon BLE device streaming fetus heartbeat data.

Developing simple HTTP servers for the cause, I got into web development and decided to steer my career towards it.
While still was learning new technologies in my free time,
I was interviewed and hired as a backend developer at Divar.

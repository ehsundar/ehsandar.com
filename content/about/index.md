## Work Experience

### Arkan Ara Co.

I started to work as a Qt developer in 2017.
I developed different software parts of an electrocardiogram device.
The code was written in C++ and we used Qt framework for the GUI part.
The whole system wsa running on a raspberry pi devices.
where I learned to work with the terminal for the first time.
I had a hard time figuring out how to cross compile the code for the raspberry pi devices as
the online resources was not as helpful as it is today.
I also initiated a number of projects
which involved working with BLE devices and sensors, 
namely SensorTile by ST and an uncommon BLE device streaming fetus heartbeat data.

### Divar

I started to work as a backend developer in 2019.

👋 I'm Amir. I work as a software engineer ⚙️ but I am also interested in wood working and hiking.

Go, Postgres🐘 and sqlc are my go-to for web projects, so you can find my boilerplate here at [go-boilerplate](https://github.com/ehsundar/go-boilerplate)

I'd like to make contributions on linters and automation tools written in Go language. 
I write some of my technical opinions here at [ehsandar.top](https://ehsandar.top). Feel free to take a look and share your thoughts through [starting a new discussion](https://github.com/ehsundar/ehsundar/discussions/new/choose).
